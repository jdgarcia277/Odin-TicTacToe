# Odin-Tic Tac Toe Project

This Tic Tac Toe project, part of the Odin curriculum, exemplifies advanced JavaScript concepts using a modular pattern. Key aspects include:

- **Modular Pattern with IIFE**: Demonstrating encapsulation and minimal global scope usage, leading to a clean, maintainable codebase.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Distinct modules for gameboard, game logic, and players, showcasing organized and logical code structure.
- **Interactive DOM Manipulation**: Enhancing user experience through direct webpage interactions for game functionality.
- **Planned Enhancements**: Future updates include visual indicators for player turns and comprehensive UI styling.

The project illustrates modular JavaScript's power in creating structured, interactive web applications, with a focus on extending functionality and user interface in future updates.
